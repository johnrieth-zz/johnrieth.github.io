Does California need an AI strategy?

Maybe. It seems a lot of strategies are simply wishlists and do not reflect the current work being done. So, California can create an AI strategy but the implementation is the more important thing. I do my best to make this post a wishlist but fundamentally it is a wishlist. I take heavily from the Obama Administration's report [THE NATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN (October 2016)](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/national_ai_rd_strategic_plan.pdf)

The Trump Administration seems unwilling to commit more energy to the role of the federal government in AI. The government of California cannot replace the role of the federal government but the state can do more than the Trump administration is planning.

### Government AI Strategies
The strategies below are either from governments, researchers, or interpretations of government strategies.

#### The United States

### Basics

California needs to ensure access to housing, water, and food. Basic research cannot be done without the basic necessities of life.

**Housing**: The state is too expensive. San Francisco and Los Angeles have not built enough housing. The state government needs to do more. 

**Water**: Climate change is impacting and will impact the availability of water in the state.

### Nurturing Talent

Research still comes from academia.  California is home to world-class universities in the research of AI. The use of mathematics is the driving force behind the "smart" revolution. The future workforce will likely need to have knowledge of mathematics. State funding of public education has been falling for years. I do not think the education system needs to be reformed to focus on programming. The study and implementation of artificial intelligence is challenging. The mathematics and engineering involved takes years for people to understand. State officials should not believe that investing in AI will lead to more people implementing the stuff. 

### Software & Hardware

Artificial Intelligence does not happen without software and hardware. The current hardware is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Google has created a Tensor Processing Unit for research. Hardware is under the research category of computer architecture. 

### The Role of the California Government
The building blocks for industry. What research areas will most benefit from state investment?

Funding the education of Californians.
Put the focus on mathematics and then computer science
**Security**: Adversarial tester of software and hardware. Companies need to verify that their systems are as secure as possible. The current environment is not capable of dealing with the combination of AI and the Internet of Things.
