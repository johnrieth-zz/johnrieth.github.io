## Notes

### Intercom on Onboarding

* Onboarding is part of the product and an experience that all users will experience (4)
* Onboarding is about getting your customers to success (6)
  * the outcome of good onboarding is successful users (7)
* Problem: people sign-up, spend some time, and then disappear (11)
  * onboarding is "turning new signups into loyal and engaged customers" (11)
* Progress bars don't ensure that the user achieves their goals (13)
  * too internally focused
* "modern onboarding focuses on the user and what they want to achieve" (15)
  * What jobs has the product been hired for? 
  * What are people trying to achieve with the product? (15)
* "If you want more people to adopt your product, you have to make sure you know what progress looks like in your user's life, not just on their screen." (23)
* Ask questions to people who recently went through the onboarding process (26)
  * Why did they switch? What parts of the onboarding were tricky? (27)
* "People sign up for products because they're frustrated with their current situation" (31)
* Differentiate user onboarding for different types of users. (37)
* "When your audience changes, so does your onboarding" (51)
* "It's important to remember redesigns have a shelf life too. The contexts that inspire a redesign will continue to shift over time" (53)
* People need to see the value of your website/app/software to continue to use it (60)
* "the reality of product management is not all your new features will be successful" (62)
* With onboarding, "You should presume not everyone will have the ability or permission to complete every setp, and provide ways for users to invite the people they need to help them" (90)
* Go through you own onboarding process frequently to understand the experience (97)
* "good onboarding retains customers over time by continually showing them how to get the most out of your product" (107)
* The goal for a new feature is for it to be used (108)

### Inclusive Microsoft Design

* "The interactions we design with technology depend heavilyon what we can see, hear, say, and touch" (8)
* "Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases" (16)
* "Disability is context dependent" (18)
* Disability: mismatched human interaction (22)
* "Inclusive design puts people in the center from the very start of the process" (26)
* "Interactions with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, touch, learn, and remember" (30)
* "Inclusive design works across a spectrum of related abilities, connecting different people in similar circumstances"(34)
* "Designing with constraints in mind is simply designing well" (36)
