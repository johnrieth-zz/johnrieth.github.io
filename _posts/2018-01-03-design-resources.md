## Notes

### Intercom on Onboarding

- Onboarding is part of the product and an experience that all users will experience
- Onboarding is about getting your customers to success
  - the outcome on good onboarding is successful users
- Problem: people sign-up, spend some time, and then disappear
- Progress bars don't ensure that the user achieves their goals
- What jobs has the product been hired for?
- What are people trying to achieve with the product?
- "If you want more people to adopt your product, you have to make sure you know what progress looks like in your user's life, not just on their screen." (23)
- Ask questions to people who recently went through the onboarding process (23)
  - Why did they switch? What parts of the onboarding were tricky? (27)
- "People sign up for products because they're frustrated with their current situation" (31)
- Differentiate user onboarding for different types of users.

### Inclusive Microsoft Design

- "The interactions we design with technology depend heavilyon what we can see, hear, say, and touch" (8)
- "Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases" (16)
- "Disability is context dependent" (18)
- Disability: mismatched human interaction (22)
- "Inclusive design puts people in the center from the very start of the process" (26)
- "Interactions with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, touch, learn, and remember" (30)
- "Inclusive design works across a spectrum of related abilities, connecting different people in similar circumstances"(34)
- "Designing with constraints in mind is simply designing well" (36)
