# Ideas

__Designing a Central Bank Assistant (CBA)__

The idea is to design an agent that is similar to Siri/Alexa/Google Assistant for central bankers. Central bankers should be able to ask the agent questions that could be asked of similar central bankers. Such as "Should we raise rates?" and "What will unemployment be in two years?" Synthesizing research will also be useful to help make decisions. A problem is what kind of research should be given to the CBA. Feeding in poorly done research will harm the potential efficacy of the CBA. The CBA cannot be objective as it will be programmed by humans and fed information that has been created by humans. 

 Information retrieval and question answering will be necessary parts for a useful CBA.
