The list of papers and links are going to a mess for a while I figure out the best structure. Most ideas I have are going to be wrong.

## Ideas

__Designing a Central Bank Governor__

The idea is to design an agent that is similar to Siri/Alexa/Google Assistant for central bankers. Central bankers should be able to ask the agent questions that could be asked of similar central bankers. The Central Bank Assistant (CBA) should not become a voting member in anything similar to the ... The CBA is not able to be objective as it will be programmed by humans and fed information that has been created by humans. 

The CBA is going to be primarily a recommender system to make recommendations to the Central Bank on policy decisions. Natural Language Processing is going to be involved. Rein

__RegBot__
Regulation is important to understand. Using something like Facebook's Q&A system with financial regulations could be a good use of information. The challenge will be getting the bot understand how a certain regulation interacts with a company's business.
