I am learning [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/) and specifically recurrent neural nets (RNNs). There are [three solid tutorials about RNNs for text generation](http://gluon.mxnet.io/chapter05_recurrent-neural-networks/simple-rnn.html). The text I am using for the tutorials is MiFID II. Below, I am going to share what the RNNs generate. I am running the tutorials on a CPU so I am using 50 epochs insteatd of 2000 which the tutorials use. 

The plain RNN and LSTM at epoch 49 resemble MiFID II the most but are still not close to human generated text.
