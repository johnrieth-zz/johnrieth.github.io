[Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) is a set of JavaScript libraries from Google that help developers add offline support for their websites. The guides on the Workbox website are helpful and laid out in a straightforward way. I am using Workbox along with a U.S. Web Design System template for a proof of concept for government agencies to use Workbox or something like it.
