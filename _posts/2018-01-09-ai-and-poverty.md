Elisabeth A. Mason, founding director of the Stanford Poverty and Technology Lab, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled [A.I. and Big Data Could Power a New War on Poverty](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/opinion/ai-and-big-data-could-power-a-new-war-on-poverty.html?_r=0). The op-ed is good because it discusses the possibilities of using artificial intelligence and big data in helping alleviate poverty. Mason begins the article by stating how artificial intelligence is possibly going to make millions of Americans unemployed. She then points out that A.I. can help the unemployed. I am going to list out quotes from the op-ed and give my comments beneath them. Doing so leads to a distortion of her argument but I feel the quotes are representative of her argument. My questions are the implemenation aspects of using A.I. and big data to alleviate poverty. 

"First, even as A.I. threatens to put people out of work, it can simultaneously be used to match them to good middle-class jobs that are going unfilled."   - Is there going to be one website that Americans will be able to go to get matched?
    - Who will be responsible for the design of the website and of the A.I. matching system?
    - Will the code for A.I. matching system be public? 
    - What are the mechanics of an invdividual using the website? 
    - How will A.I. matching system be marketed so people will know about and understand the system?
    - Will people be able to use Linked-In to upload their resume? What if a person does not have a Linked-In?
    - How will job sites like Indeed and Monster respond? 
    - How many middle-class jobs are there that are going unfilled?

"Likewise, A.I. can predict where the job openings of tomorrow will lie, and which skills and training will be needed for them."
    - Where will the government get this data?
    - What incintive do employers have of giving their data?
    - Who will be responsible for writing and maintaining the code for predicting "the job opening of tomorrow"?

"Even within the context of a standardized curriculum, A.I. “tutors” can home in on and correct for each student’s weaknesses, adapt coursework to his or her learning style and keep the student engaged."
    - Will the "tutors" be free?
    - How will "tutors" be analyzed for effectiveness?
        - What are the metrics of a successful A.I. "tutor"?
    - Who will be responsible for creating and maintaining the "tutor" code?
    - How much data will be necessary to create a "tutor" that is effective?
        - Where will that data come from?

"Big data sets can now be harnessed to better predict which programs help certain people at a given time and to quickly assess whether programs are having the desired effect."
    - What kind of big data sets will be harnessed?
    - How is "quickly" defined? 2 months? 6 months? A year?
    - Who will be responsible for analyzing and predicting the success of programs?
        - How will the prediction be given to the public and policymakers?
