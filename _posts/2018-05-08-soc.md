This post documents the goal of a redesigned website for the [U.S. Army Special Operations Command website](http://www.soc.mil/). 

This README is [adapted from 18F](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md)

### USASOC

The USASOC oversees special operations forces of the U.S. Army. 

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users of the site are future and current members of the USASOC community.

Stakeholders are likely to be USASOC recruiters and members, U.S. Army, and the Department of Defense.

### Questions

- Why does the USASOC have a website?
- Why do people use the website?
- What are users trying to accomplish?

### Product vision

* Presents users a functional, modern interface
* Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
* Uses U.S. Web Design System or the U.S. Army's style to build upon secure and proven code
* Usable on multiple devices
