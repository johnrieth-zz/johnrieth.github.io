title: Joint Communications Unit (JCU) Website Redesign
description: Joint Communications Unit Website Path Analysis and Redesign
category: design
---

This post contains ideas and a prototype of a redesigned website for the Joint Communications Unit. [Current JCU website](http://jcu.mil) and [proposed JCU website](https://johnrieth.github.io/jcu/).

I have adapted [18f's US Air Force Recruiting Service Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md) layout and content for the post.

### JCU

The mission of the Joint Communications Unit is to ensure that the communications procedures and equipment work reliably and effectively for the Joint Special Operations Command and its subordinate units.

(adapted from [http://jcu.mil/](http://jcu.mil/))

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users are current military personnel and civilians who are interested in joining the unit.

Stakeholders are likely to be JCU recruiters, Joint Special Operations Command, and the Department of Defense.

### Product vision

* Presents potential recruits a functional, modern interface
* Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
* Uses U.S. Web Design System to build upon proven code.
    * Possibly easier to update than jQuery. Current site uses javascript libraries jQuery@1.9.1, jQuery UI@1.11.3, Bootstrap@3.3.1 that each have one vulnerability
* Remove the ```<meta http-equiv="refresh">``` to make user experience better
* Close ```<head></head>``` so ```<meta name="viewport>"``` is registed by browser
* Finish implementing website search

### Success metrics

* Increase the number of high-quality recruits
