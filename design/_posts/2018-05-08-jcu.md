title: Joint Communications Unit (JCU) Path Analysis
description: Joint Communications Unit Website Path Analysis and Redesign
category: design
---

This post contains ideas and a prototype of a redesigned website for [the Joint Communications Unit](http://jcu.mil). I have created [a basic information architecture redesign for the site].

I have adapted [18f's US Air Force Recruiting Service Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md) layout and content for the post.

### JCU

The mission of the Joint Communications Unit is to ensure that the communications procedures and equipment work reliably and effectively for the Joint Special Operations Command and its subordinate units.

(adapted from [http://jcu.mil/](http://jcu.mil/))

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users are current military personnel and civilians who are interested in joining the unit.

Stakeholders are likely to be JCU recruiters, Joint Special Operations Command, and the Department of Defense.

### Product vision

* Presents potential recruits a functional, modern interface
* Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)

### Next Steps
* Remove the ```<meta http-equiv="refresh">``` to make user experience better
* Finish implementing website search
* Update jQuery@1.9.1, jQuery UI@1.11.3, Bootstrap@3.3.1 libraries due to security vulnerabilities
