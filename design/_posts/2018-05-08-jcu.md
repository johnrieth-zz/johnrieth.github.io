title: Joint Communications Unit (JCU) Path Analysis
description: Joint Communications Unit Website Path Analysis and Redesign
category: design
---

This post contains ideas and a prototype of a redesigned website for [the Joint Communications Unit](http://jcu.mil). I have created [a basic redesign using the U.S. Web Design System](https://johnrieth.github.io/jcu/).

I have adapted [18f's US Air Force Recruiting Service Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md) layout and content for the post.

### JCU

The mission of the Joint Communications Unit is to ensure that the communications procedures and equipment work reliably and effectively for the Joint Special Operations Command and its subordinate units.

(adapted from [http://jcu.mil/](http://jcu.mil/))

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users are current military personnel interested in joining the Unit.

Stakeholders are likely to be JCU recruiters and command.

### Product vision

* Presents potential recruits a functional, modern interface usable on multiple devices
* Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/) and redirects to HTTPS
* 

### Next Steps

* Remove the ```<meta http-equiv="refresh">``` to make user experience better
* Move ```<meta name="viewport">``` to be near the other meta tags
* Finish implementing website search
* Content audit
    * Who is responsible for writing, editing, and maintaining content?
* Update jQuery@1.9.1, jQuery UI@1.11.3, Bootstrap@3.3.1 libraries due to security vulnerabilities **or** adopt the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)
