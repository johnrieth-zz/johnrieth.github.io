description: U.S. Army Special Operations Command Website Path Analysis and Redesign
category: design
---

This post documents a path towards a redesigned website for the [U.S. Army Special Operations Command website](http://www.soc.mil/).

I have adapted [18f's US Air Force Recruiting Service Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md) layout and content for the post.

### USASOC

The USASOC oversees special operations forces of the U.S. Army.

(adapted from [http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html](http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html))

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users of the site are future and current members of the USASOC community.

Stakeholders are likely to be USASOC recruiters and members, U.S. Army, and the Department of Defense.

### Questions

- Why do people use the website?
- What are users trying to accomplish?
    - How does the website help users accomplish their goals?

### Product vision

- Presents users a functional, modern interface
- Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
- Uses [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) or the U.S. Army's style to build upon secure and proven code
- Usable on multiple devices
- Accessible to everyone

### Next steps

- Plan to add:
    -  ```<meta name="viewport">```
    - ```<title>Title of site</title>```
    - ```<html lang="en">```
    - ```<meta name="Description" content="Description of page">```
- Plan out caching of assets
- Increase font size
- Conduct content audit
- Redo information architecture
- Do user research
    - Put focus on new members and their families. What do they need from the website?
