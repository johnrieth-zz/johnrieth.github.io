This post documents a path towards a redesigned website for the [CAL FIRE website](http://calfire.ca.gov/).

I have adapted [18f's US Air Force Recruiting Service Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md) layout and content for the post.

### USASOC

The USASOC oversees special operations forces of the U.S. Army.

(adapted from [http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html](http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html))

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users of the site are future and current members of the USASOC community.

Stakeholders are likely to be USASOC recruiters and members, U.S. Army, and the Department of Defense.

### Questions

- Why do people use the website?
- What are users trying to accomplish?
    - How does the website help users accomplish their goals?

### Product vision

- Presents users functional, modern interface
- Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
- Uses [California Web Standards](https://webstandards.ca.gov/) or an adapation to build upon open-source code
- Usable on multiple devices without needing a [mobile specific site](http://m.fire.ca.gov/)

### Next steps

- Plan to add:
    - ```<meta charset="utf-8">
    -  ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">``` for responsiveness
    - Simplify and use ```<html lang="en">```
    - ```<meta name="Description" content="Description of page">``` focus on CAL FIRE 
- Use Let's Encrypt for security certificate
- Optimize images to increase load
- Conduct content audit
- Leverage browser caching for better peformance
