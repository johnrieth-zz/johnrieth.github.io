* Create a [plan](https://libereurope.eu/blog/2018/07/05/frenchopenscienceplan/) for [open](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/open-innovation-open-science-open-world-vision-europe) [science](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25116/open-science-by-design-realizing-a-vision-for-21st-century) at the Bank. Open science is part of ensuring [research](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science) is as [true](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) as [possible](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf) and that policy decisions are based on [credible](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6351/531) [research](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/733696/reproducible-research-moving-toward-research-public-can-really-trust). Economics 

* To the fullest extent possible make [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05990-5) [funded](https://www.ijcb.org/about/sponsors.htm) by the Bank be [reproducible](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021), follow [best](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/learning/best-practice-in-open-research/#/id/5abe17ffdd1827131b90e618) [practices](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-876/v1), and [open](https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/) [access](http://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies) by [default](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf). The Bank's [working papers](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/working-papers/) are open access but do not appear to be reproducible or follow best practices. Making researchers follow best practices will make the Bank look more credible. Research is challenging and 

* Support and build the open source economics community: [Open Source Macroeconomics Laboratory](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro), [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.org/), [New York Fed DSGE](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE). Open source can be a part of the Bank to [advance science](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/07/12/the-case-for-open-source-software/), [reduce costs](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), [make better software](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), and increase research [reproducibility](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285). Working with the open source community . To accomplish the goal adopting an open source software policy would give employees and the public a better sense of software.

* Create a [lab](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-123.pdf) similar to [Le Lab Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en/banque-de-france/about-banque-de-france/le-lab-banque-de-france) to create and fund research methods and computational tools. The lab would offer space, money, and resources for researchers inside and outside the Bank to experiment 

* Explore a central hub for research.
