The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank is in the process of [finding a new president and chief executive officer](https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/leadership/office-of-the-president/presidential-search-san-francisco-fed/?utm_source=frbsf-home-presidential-search-more&utm_medium=frbsf&utm_campaign=presidential-search). [John C. Williams](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/orgchart/williams), prior holder of both positions, is now head of the New York Federal Reserve. The recommendations cover monetary policy, diversity, and economics research. The focus is on improving how economics research is conducted.

### Recommendations

#### Monetary Policy

* Argue the [natural unemployment rate](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2017/august/natural-rate-of-unemployment-over-past-100-years/) is between [2%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/03/19/the-unemployment-rate-is-low-it-should-be-even-lower/?utm_term=.46543b058e8d) and [2.5%](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~cfm754/lure_of_incredible_certitude.pdf) to further the pursuit of [full employment](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/what-recovery/). [Overestimates](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/4/17320188/jobs-report-natural-rate-unemployment-inflation-economics-april) of the [natural](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-unemployment-idUSL1N0Y21L720150511) [rate](https://www.npr.org/2014/10/17/356980255/drop-in-unemployment-raises-debate-on-optimal-rate) have potentially hindered economic growth.

* Commission and publish a [no-blame](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/from-a-blame-culture-to-a-learning-culture) report on the [supervision](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-record-fine-against-wells-fargo-points-to-the-failure-of-regulation) of [Wells Fargo](https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/05/news/companies/wells-fargo-timeline/index.html) from [2011](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704430304576170702480420980) to 2017. Look to [medicine](https://improvement.nhs.uk/documents/920/serious-incidnt-framwrk.pdf) and [transportation](http://alo.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NTSB.pdf) on how to structure the report. A no-blame report could help staff learn how to improve the supervision of financial institutions.

#### Diversity

* [Increase](http://macromomblog.com/2017/10/08/rethinking-diversity-in-economics/) [diversity](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.4.221) at the Bank by implementing the [2018 action plan](https://www.frbsf.org/files/2017-OMWI-Annual-Report.pdf) and holding leadership accountable for not [achieving](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/11/28/raising-floor-sharing-what-works-workplace-diversity-equity-and-inclusion) [diversity](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/Documents/Diversity%20Equity%20Inclusion%20Action%20Grid.pdf) goals.

* Make the annual Office of Minority and Women Inclusion [report](https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/about/office-minority-women-inclusion/about-omwi/annual-report-congress/) to Congress [interactive](https://diversity.google/annual-report/) to give people an easier way to track diversity at the Bank.

#### Economics

* Create a [plan](https://libereurope.eu/blog/2018/07/05/frenchopenscienceplan/) for [open science](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/openresearch/openresearchexplained/). Open science is an important part of ensuring [research](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-statistical-crisis-in-science) is as [true](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) as [possible](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/p_hacking.pdf) and that policy decisions are based on [credible](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6351/531) [research](http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/733696/reproducible-research-moving-toward-research-public-can-really-trust).

* To the fullest extent [possible](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021) make [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05990-5) [funded](https://www.ijcb.org/about/sponsors.htm) by the Bank be [reproducible](https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/) and [open](https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/) [access](http://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies) by [default](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf).

* Create a [meta-research](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002264) group within the [Economic Research Department](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/management/) to [focus](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005468) on [improving](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/fixing_science.pdf) the [quality](https://www.nature.com/news/how-quality-control-could-save-your-science-1.19223) of [economics](http://metrics.stanford.edu/research/methods) [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06075-z).

* Support and build the open source economics community([Open Source Macroeconomics Laboratory](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro), [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/), [Econ-ARK](https://econ-ark.org/)) to [advance science](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/07/12/the-case-for-open-source-software/), [reduce costs](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), [make better software](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), and increase research reproducibility. Open source tools can increase the diversity of the economics profession to include people who cannot afford to pay for [STATA](https://www.stata.com/order/dl/) or [EViews](http://www.eviews.com/general/prices/prices.html).  

* Create a [research](https://www.lbl.gov/) [lab](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2013/EECS-2013-123.pdf) similar to [Le Lab Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en/banque-de-france/about-banque-de-france/le-lab-banque-de-france) and [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/recruitment-information) to fund innovations in research methods and computational tools.

* Partner with [NASA](https://climate.nasa.gov/), the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](http://www.noaa.gov/climate), and [research institutions](https://climatechange.ucdavis.edu/) to study the [economic](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1362) [impacts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05219-5) of the [changing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/as-temperatures-keep-trending-up-heat-belt-cities-maneuver-to-stay-livable/2018/08/29/3c7ef2f2-ab15-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?utm_term=.a1b4f5a466d9) [climate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/24/climate/dry-rio-grande.html) in the 12th District.
