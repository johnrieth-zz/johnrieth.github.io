The [California Innovation Lab](https://innovate.ca.gov/FAQs/) gives state employees the opportunity to build "[w]eb applications that solve problems". To become a leader in government innovation the lab should experiment with new web technologies and join organizations dedicated to the web. Experimenting with new web technologies is a great way for state employees to understand the future of the web. Joining web organizations will allow the lab to participate in building a web that benefits all Californians.  

**Experiments**

- Prototype the use of the [Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API) to simplify the payment of government services
- Use the [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) to test the usability of multi-factor authentication for government websites
- Create a [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_components) version of the [California Web Standards Template](https://webstandards.ca.gov/web-standards/)
- Create a [Progressive web app (PWAs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive) to understand how a PWA might make government web services more engaging

**Web organizations**

- Become a member of the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) to support . Membership for a [government agency costs $7,900 a year](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/fees?countryCode=US&quarter=01-01&year=2019#results). Becoming a member of the W3C
- Financially support the [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://ietf.org/about/) and allow a select number state employees to participate in working groups to make a better internet. [Sponsorship of a Hackathon is $40,000](https://ietf.org/how/runningcode/hackathons/).
- Work with the [UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/) to research innovative tools and policies for protecting Californians online.
