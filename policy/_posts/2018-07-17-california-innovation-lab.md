The [California State Innovation Lab](http://innovate.ca.gov/) should move from [OpenShift](https://innovate.ca.gov/FAQs/) to [OpenStack](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platform) to allow for innovation beyond web-applications. Government innovations needs to add more than the web and expanding the scope of the Innovation Lab will accomplish this.
