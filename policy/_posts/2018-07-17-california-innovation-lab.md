**Web Innovations**

- Prototype the use of the [Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API) to simplify the payment for government services
- Experiment with the [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) as a way to test multi-factor authentication for government websites
- Create a [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_components) version of the [California Web Standards Template](https://webstandards.ca.gov/web-standards/)
- Create a [Progressive web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive) to test how PWAs might make government digital services more engaging and useful.
