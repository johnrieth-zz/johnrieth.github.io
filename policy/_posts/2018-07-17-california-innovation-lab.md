The [California State Innovation Lab](http://innovate.ca.gov/) should move from [OpenShift](https://innovate.ca.gov/FAQs/) to [OpenStack](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platform) to allow for innovation beyond websites. Government innovations needs to add more than the web and expanding the scope of the Innovation Lab will accomplish this.

Web innovations to focus on:

- Prototype the use of the [Payment Request API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API) to simplify the payment for government services
- Begin to use the [Web Authentication API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) as a way to test multi-factor authentication for government websites
- Create a [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_components) version of the [California Web Standards Template](https://webstandards.ca.gov/web-standards/)
- Create [Progressive web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Progressive) to test how PWAs might make government digital services more engaging and useful
