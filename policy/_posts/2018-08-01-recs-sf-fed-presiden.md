The San Francisco Federal Reserve is in the process of [finding a new President and CEO](https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/leadership/office-of-the-president/presidential-search-san-francisco-fed/?utm_source=frbsf-home-presidential-search-more&utm_medium=frbsf&utm_campaign=presidential-search). John C. Williams, prior holder of both positions, is now leading the New York Federal Reserve. My recommendations are in part to focus on fulfilling the job requirements.

* Your first speech should focus on how you have been wrong
* Invest in making research reproducible and replicable. Use that energy to push the field of economics to do it and towards open access.
* Nominal GDP Targeting: add to the bank's toolbelt
* Start with the natural unemployment rate between 0 and 2%
* Support the open-source economics community: OpenMacro, QuantEcon, Econ-ARK
* Increase research in artificial intelligence
