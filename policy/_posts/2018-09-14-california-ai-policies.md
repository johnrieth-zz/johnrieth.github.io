### Policies for the next governor

The next governor faces a lot of challenges.  will be the most effective by implementing policies that do not directly target the research, development, and deployment of AI-based systems. These policies are what [Miles Brundage](https://twitter.com/Miles_Brundage) and [Joanna Bryson](https://twitter.com/j2bryson) call indirect and AI-relevant policies in their paper [Smart Policies for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08196). Ensuring that people in California have access to affordable housing, a healthy environment, and a good education will allow the state to be economically dynamic. The benefits of AI are unknown and that is why the next governor should focus on policies that have the potential to increase the health and socioeconomic status of Californians if an AI-economy turns out to be less than great.

### Goals

* Improved [socioeconomic](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) [mobility](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3518) and [health](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article19648839.html) [outcomes](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/california/2018/rankings/outcomes/overall)
* Home to leaders in the research and development of [software](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/hardware/david-patterson-says-its-time-for-new-computer-architectures-and-software-languages) and [hardware](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/electronics-resurgence-initiative) for AI
* Regulatory systems that protect the constitutional rights of people in California and allows for innovation

### Current government involvement

* The Little Hoover Commission, an [independent state oversight agency](http://www.lhc.ca.gov/about/history), is studying the potential impacts of [artificial intelligence in California](http://www.lhc.ca.gov/report/artificial-intelligence-applications-and-implications)
* The California Assembly [Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection has held one session on artificial intelligence](http://privacycp.assembly.ca.gov/content/2018-oversightinformational-hearings)
* The California Legislature passed [Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 215](https://futureoflife.org/2018/08/31/state-of-california-endorses-asilomar-ai-principles/) that makes the [23 Asilomar AI Principles](https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/?cn-reloaded=1) the ["guiding values for the development of artificial intelligence and of related public policy"](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180ACR215)
* California Department of Motor Vehicles has [regulations governing the testing and use of autonomous vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/bkgd)

### Indirect and Relevant

* **Make housing affordable**: The [cost](http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx) of [housing](https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/article217737305.html) makes [life too hard](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article218694970.html#navlink=SecList) and [pushes](https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article211785244.html) people out of the state. Making housing affordable will improve socioeconomic mobility, combat climate change, and help advance science. The lack of housing hampers higher education graduation rates which is a driver of high debt loads. There is no single [solution](https://urbanize.la/post/25-solutions-builder%E2%80%99s-perspective-fix-california-housing-crisis) for [creating](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/08/06/both-renters-and-homeowners-could-benefit-from-better-housing-policy/) [affordable](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/05/02/nine-rules-for-better-housing-policy/) [housing](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article213258809.html) because there are many Californians who do not want more [housing](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur). Having homeownership be a tool for wealth is not good.

* **Continue to combat climate**: [Climate change is impacting and will impact the availability of water](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/31/california-drought-jerry-brown-sets-permanent-water-conservation-rules-with-new-laws/) and [food in the state](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/3/25). The impacts of climate change make it harder for people to stay in California. Explore [reforms](http://www.ppic.org/publication/managing-drought-in-a-changing-climate-four-essential-reforms/) to manage less water.

* **Increase funding for higher education institutions**: [State](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/) [universities](http://ai.ucsd.edu/) are at the forefront of the research and development of AI. To ensure that remains the case, there needs to be an [increase of State General Fund Support](https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/approaching-tipping-point-history-and-prospectus-funding-university-california-john) to the [UCs](https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/even-as-uc-enrollment-has-increased-state-general-fund-support-has-declined/) and [CSUs](https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/even-as-csu-enrollment-has-increased-state-general-fund-support-has-declined/). The funding should not go to AI programs but instead most of an increase in funding should be towards increasing [food and housing security] and [graduation rates] . If increases to higher education are not politically feasible then UC and CSU will need to increase their lobbying efforts to receive more federal funding. The increase in funding may have to come from the federal government which means 

* **Increase retention in STEM**: Work with non-profits and education institutions to retain underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math. Discrimination against underrepresented people is [wrong](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1809846?query=recirc_top_ribbon_article_1) and it is important to combat [discrimination](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic).

### Direct

* **Create an AI policy lab**: The main mission of the lab should be to advise the use and regulation of AI in California. The lab could be part of the [California Council on Science & Technology](https://ccst.us/about.php) which provides "independent assessment of public policy issues affecting the State of California relating to science and technology". The California Council's budget and personnel will need to increase to meet the public policy challenges brought by the deployment of AI-based systems.

* **Invest in agriculture research**: [Increase funding into robotics](https://www.bna.com/farm-robots-need-n73014476434/)and AI through the California higher education system. [The UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources](http://ucanr.edu/) with CSU [Agricultural Research Institute](https://www2.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/ari) could be the best way for farmers to learn about advances in robotics and AI for farming.
  * UC Extension scientists are already doing so with [a prototype mechanized vineyard](http://ucanr.edu/sites/StrategicInitiatives/?blogpost=27519&blogasset=99615).
  * A focus needs to be on ways to ensure access to water for farmers while reducing the use of it. An additional funding opportunity is the CSU [Water Resources and Policy Initiatives](http://www.calstate.edu/water/).
  * 
* **Continue to build high-quality datasets**: Data is 

* **Partner to fight fires**: Explore a partnership between [CAL FIRE's Research and Development Program](http://calfire.ca.gov/about/about_Research&Development), Caltech's [Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies](http://www.cast.caltech.edu/), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology's [Fire Research Division](https://www.nist.gov/el/fire-research-division-73300) to plan the use of autonomous systems for fire protection and prevention. CAL FIRE does not have [autonomous systems](http://calfire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Glance.pdf) and had to use [California Air National Guard drones](https://abc7news.com/technology/drones-helping-to-fight-wildfires-in-california/3873875/) to fight wildfires. Autonomous systems can give CAL FIRE better situational awareness. CAL FIRE's procurement process may need to be examined to get the necessary technology quickly into the hands of firefighters.
