### Goals

* An affordable and healthy place to work and live
* Home to leaders in research and development of [software](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/computing/hardware/david-patterson-says-its-time-for-new-computer-architectures-and-software-languages) and [hardware](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/electronics-resurgence-initiative)
* Improved socioeconomic [mobility](https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3518)

### Current government involvement

* The Little Hoover Commission, an [independent state oversight agency](http://www.lhc.ca.gov/about/history), is [studying artificial intelligence in California](http://www.lhc.ca.gov/report/artificial-intelligence-applications-and-implications)
* The California Assembly [Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection has held one session on artificial intelligence](http://privacycp.assembly.ca.gov/content/2018-oversightinformational-hearings)
* More than 20 State Assemblymembers are trying to pass a measure that will support the [23 Asilomar AI Principles](https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/?cn-reloaded=1) as the ["guiding values for the development of artificial intelligence and of related public policy"](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180ACR215)
* California Department of Motor Vehicles has [regulations governing the testing and use of autonomous vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/bkgd)

### Policies for the California State Government

The state government will be the most effective by implementing policies that do not directly target the research, development, and deployment of AI-based systems. These policies are what [Miles Brundage](https://twitter.com/Miles_Brundage) and [Joanna Bryson](https://twitter.com/j2bryson) call indirect and AI-relevant policies in their paper [Smart Policies for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08196). Ensuring that people in California have access to clean water, affordable housing, a good education, and  will help the state be home to leaders in AI. Without those

### Indirect and Relevant

* **Make housing affordable**: The [cost](http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx) of [housing](https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/article217737305.html) makes the state too expensive to live in. Researchers cannot do good work when their quality of life is less than great. Making housing affordable will improve socioeconomic mobility and help advance science. There is no single [solution](https://urbanize.la/post/25-solutions-builder%E2%80%99s-perspective-fix-california-housing-crisis) for [creating](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/08/06/both-renters-and-homeowners-could-benefit-from-better-housing-policy/) [affordable](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/05/02/nine-rules-for-better-housing-policy/) [housing](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article213258809.html).  Policies to make housing affordable should incorporate [better land use planning](http://ucanr.edu/?blogpost=27902&blogasset=96361) to reduce losses due to wildfires.

* **Combat climate change**: [Climate change is impacting and will impact the availability of water](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/31/california-drought-jerry-brown-sets-permanent-water-conservation-rules-with-new-laws/) and [food in the state](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/3/25). The impacts of climate change make it harder for people to stay in California. Explore [reforms](http://www.ppic.org/publication/managing-drought-in-a-changing-climate-four-essential-reforms/) to manage less water.

* **Stabilize higher education funding**: Education is too expensive. 

* **Increase retention in STEM**: Work with non-profits and education institutions to retain underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math. Discrimination against underrepresented people is [wrong](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1809846?query=recirc_top_ribbon_article_1) and it is important to combat [discrimination](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic). 

### Direct

* **Create an AI lab**: The main mission of the lab should be to advise the use and regulation of AI in California. Helping the state legislature figure out the best way to regulate [facial](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/technology/microsoft-facial-recognition.html) [recognition](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17792976/facial-recognition-regulation-rules) would be a good fit for the lab. The lab could be part of the [California Council on Science & Technology](https://ccst.us/about.php) which would allow researchers to .

* **Fund research in select sectors**: The sectors for the state government to focus on are taken from [The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/national_ai_rd_strategic_plan.pdf) and the [French Strategy for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/). The sectors are not an exhaustive list but instead are meant to be a starting point for the state to support.
  * **Healthcare**: There are [interesting](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/jsr-17-task-002_aiforhealthandhealthcare12122017.pdf) [developments](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/japans-robot-revolution-in-senior-care/) in the intersection of [AI and healthcare](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/uoc--nuc072718.php) and the focus 
    * Stanford's [Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging](https://aimi.stanford.edu/)
    * UC San Diego's [Contextual Robotics Institute](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/contextualrobotics/index.sfe)
    * USC's [Health, Technology and Engineering program](https://hte.usc.edu/)
    * The Google Brain Team's [research area of healthcare and biosciences](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/)
  * **Agriculture**: Assist farmers adapt to [climate change](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/3/25) and [increase R&D into robotics](https://www.bna.com/farm-robots-need-n73014476434/). [The UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources](http://ucanr.edu/) could be the best way for farmers to learn about robotics and AI advances in farming. UC Extension scientists are already doing so with [a prototype mechanized vineyard](http://ucanr.edu/sites/StrategicInitiatives/?blogpost=27519&blogasset=99615).
  * **Emergency Services**: Help predict natural disasters and use AI systems in responding to disasters (robotics in fire fighting and search & rescue).
    * Caltech's Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies has three "moonshot" challenges that focus on [emergency service responses](http://www.cast.caltech.edu/)
    * The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a [Smart Firefighting Project](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/smart-firefighting-project) that focuses on "smart building and robotic sensor technologies, smart fire fighter equipment and robotic mapping technologies, and smart fire department apparatus and equipment"
