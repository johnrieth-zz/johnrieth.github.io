### Desired outcomes

* Be the state for the research, development, and deployment of AI systems
* The use of AI  
* 

### Current government involvement

* The Little Hoover Commission, an independent state oversight agency, is [studying artificial intelligence in California](http://www.lhc.ca.gov/report/artificial-intelligence-applications-and-implications)
* The California Assembly [Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection has held one session on artificial intelligence](http://privacycp.assembly.ca.gov/content/2018-oversightinformational-hearings)
* More than 20 State Assemblymembers are trying to pass a measure that will support the [23 Asilomar AI Principles](https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/?cn-reloaded=1) as the ["guiding values for the development of artificial intelligence and of related public policy"](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180ACR215)
* California Department of Motor Vehicles has [regulations governing the testing and use of autonomous vehicles](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/bkgd)

### Policies for the California State Government

The state government will be the most effective by implementing policies that do not directly target the research, development, and deployment of AI. These policies are what Miles Brundage and Joanna Bryson call indirect and AI-relevant policies in their paper [Smart Policies for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08196). A reason for focusing on indirect policies is that the policy outcomes have the potential to be beneficial to people in California beyond those working in artificial intelligence. The policies below will be challenging to implement, may not be the correct policies, and politically infeasible.

### Indirect and Relevant

* **Make housing affordable**: [The price of housing makes the state too expensive to live in](http://www.lao.ca.gov/reports/2015/finance/housing-costs/housing-costs.aspx). The high cost of housing makes it an easier decision for entrepreneurs, companies, and non-profits working in AI to locate somewhere else to the detriment of the state. There is no shortage of [ideas](https://urbanize.la/post/25-solutions-builder%E2%80%99s-perspective-fix-california-housing-crisis) for [better](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/08/06/both-renters-and-homeowners-could-benefit-from-better-housing-policy/) [housing](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/05/02/nine-rules-for-better-housing-policy/) [policy](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/influencers/article213258809.html) but implementation is [challenging](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur). Policies to make housing affordable should incorporate [better land use planning](http://ucanr.edu/?blogpost=27902&blogasset=96361) to reduce wildlife losses.


* ****: [Climate change is impacting and will impact the availability of water](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/31/california-drought-jerry-brown-sets-permanent-water-conservation-rules-with-new-laws/) and [food in the state](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/3/25). The impacts of climate change make it harder for people to stay in California. 

* **Social Insurance**: [Reform social insurance programs](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/news/report-the-free-market-welfare-state-preserving-dynamism-in-a-volatile-world/) to assist people in California better adapt to job loss. The state is already doing this with [CalSavers](https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/scib/)which "offers employees a completely voluntary, low cost, portable retirement savings vehicle". It is unknown the impact of AI will have on [employment](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/) . 

* **Retention**: Work with non-profits and education institutions to retain underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and math. Discrimination is an issue and one that .

### Direct

* **A Government AI Lab**: The best way to develop government expertise is for the state to be active in developing and deploying AI. The main mission of the lab should be to advise the use of AI by the executive, legislative, and judicial bodies. Advances in AI can be overhyped Before creating the AI Lab it makes sense to study the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us), the United Kingdom's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, to learn from. 

* **Guide Government Use**: The California legislature should make the code and operating procedures of any AI system used by governments to be publicly available. Before put into production a system should meet certain criteria like [audibility](http://www.fatml.org/resources/principles-for-accountable-algorithms) and [fairness](https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/?cn-reloaded=1). The criteria could be in the form of a [checklist](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/of-oaths-and-checklists) or a [framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework) to connect principles to practice. 

* **Focus Research in Sectors**: The sectors for the state government to focus on are taken from [The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/national_ai_rd_strategic_plan.pdf) and the [French Strategy for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/). The sectors are not an exhaustive list but instead are meant to be a starting point for the government to support.
  * **Healthcare**: There are [interesting](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/jsr-17-task-002_aiforhealthandhealthcare12122017.pdf) [developments](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/japans-robot-revolution-in-senior-care/) in the intersection of [AI and healthcare](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/uoc--nuc072718.php) but skepticism is important as [STAT News found that IBM's Watson use in cancer care failed to live up to expectations](https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/05/watson-ibm-cancer/).
    * Stanford's [Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging](https://aimi.stanford.edu/)
    * UC San Diego's [Contextual Robotics Institute](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/contextualrobotics/index.sfe)
    * USC's [Health, Technology and Engineering program](https://hte.usc.edu/)
    * The Google Brain Team's [research area of healthcare and biosciences](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/)
  * **Agriculture**: [Assist farmers adapt to climate change](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/3/25)  and [increase R&D into robotics](https://www.bna.com/farm-robots-need-n73014476434/). [The UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources](http://ucanr.edu/) could be the best way for farmers to learn about robotics and AI advances in farming. UC Extension scientists are already doing so with [a prototype mechanized vineyard](http://ucanr.edu/sites/StrategicInitiatives/?blogpost=27519&blogasset=99615).
  * **Emergency Services**: Help predict natural disasters and use AI systems in responding to disasters (robotics in fire fighting and search & rescue).
    * Caltech's [Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies has three "moonshot" challenges that focus on emergency service responses](http://www.cast.caltech.edu/)
    * The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a [Smart Firefighting Project that focuses on "smart building and robotic sensor technologies, smart fire fighter equipment and robotic mapping technologies, and smart fire department apparatus and equipment"](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/smart-firefighting-project)
