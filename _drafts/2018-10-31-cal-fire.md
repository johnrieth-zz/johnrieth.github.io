This post documents a path towards a redesigned website for the [CAL FIRE website](http://calfire.ca.gov/).

I have adapted [18f's US Air Force Recruiting Service Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md) layout and content for the post.

### USASOC

The USASOC oversees special operations forces of the U.S. Army.

(adapted from [http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html](http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html))

### Users and stakeholders

Potential users of the site are people in California.

Stakeholders are likely to be CAL FIRE leadership, the California Legislature, and the Department of Technology.

### Questions

- Who are the actual users?
- Why do people use the website?
- What are users trying to accomplish?
    - How does the website help users accomplish their goals?

### Product vision

- Presents users a functional, modern interface
- Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
- Uses [California Web Standards](https://webstandards.ca.gov/) or an adaptation for the front-end
- Usable on multiple devices without needing a [mobile specific site](http://m.fire.ca.gov/)

### Next steps

- Plan to add:
    - ```<meta charset="utf-8">```
    -  ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">``` for responsiveness
    - Simplify and use ```<html lang="en">``` instead of ```<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">```
    - [Content Security Policy](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security#content-security-policy) to prevent cross-site scripting
- Load jQuery over HTTPS instead of HTTP for better security
- Move to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for security certificates to save money
- Optimize images to increase website performance
- Conduct content audit to keep information up to date
- Leverage browser caching of assets for better website performance
