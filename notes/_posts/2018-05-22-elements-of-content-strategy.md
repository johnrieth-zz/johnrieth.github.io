"Content strategy plans for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content." - Kristina Halvorson (1)

Content strategy "Allows organizations to develop realistic, sustainable, and measurable publishing plans that keep their content on track in the long term" (1)

"Content is appropiate for users when it helps them accomplish their goals" (4)

"Define a clear, specific purpose for each piece of content; evaluate content against this purpose" (7)

How much of content is unnecessary? (11)

Create a plan for creating, updating, and maintaining content. The maintenance of content is important and does not happen on its own. (12-13)
   * Content has a lifecycle
   * Will only happen when it is a job for someone

Know the resources available. Trying to implement a new content strategy without the necessary resources will fail (22)

Design should not be in the way of people engaging with content (26)
   * Reduce design noise

Content is about selling an action, idea, or product

Information architects "build structures that help users find what they're looking for and accomplish the task they set out to do" (34)

Content strategy "produces plans, guidelines, schedules, and goals for content" (37)

Be an advocate for the user. Without the user you will fail to achieve business goals (47)

What are the success criterias for the project? (50)

Content audit: understand what content already exists and who "owns" the content

"document the publishing flow: how content is planned, created, approved, produced, and maintained" (54)

Competitive review: an audit of a competitor's content. Understand and write down what seems to work and not work

Understand "what the content on each page is supposed to accomplish" (60)

Content management (69)
   * Create a schedule for editorial reviews of content
   * "translation and localization efforts"
   * "Editorial planning sessions to define change in theme and to introduce new campaigns"
